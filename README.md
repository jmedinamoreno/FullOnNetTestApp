This is a demo app to show my skills as programmer.
This app uses Retrofit to load some data from the api https://randomuser.me/, then shows it in a list 
and when the user clicks in one of the items, it loads a image for that item using Glide.
This can also be used as example of how to desing an app in Compose using the strengs of ViewModel and LiveData backed with the kotlin Flow interface.
